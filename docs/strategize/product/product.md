# With Rapid Product Discovery and Prototyping

At RepublicofData.io, we start every 6-week sprint with product discovery, which is then quickly followed by prototyping, user feedback, product iteration, and finally a working Minimum Valuable Product.

## Onboarding

### Step 1: Ensuring Alignment

#### 1.1 Introduction to JTBD

- **Objective:** If necessary, familiarize the team with the JTBD framework and its relevance to data product development.
- **Activities:**
  - Conduct onboarding sessions to introduce the core concepts of JTBD.
  - Provide case studies illustrating successful implementations of JTBD in similar contexts.

#### 1.2 Introduction to The Lean Startup

- **Objective:** Introduce the core principles and methodology of The Lean Startup to the team as needed.
- **Activities:**
  - Conduct training sessions covering key concepts such as Build-Measure-Learn, Minimum Viable Product (MVP), and validated learning.
  - Share case studies illustrating successful applications of The Lean Startup in similar contexts.
  
#### 1.3 Aligning Business Goals

- **Objective:** Establish a clear connection between the organization's business goals and the application of JTBD and The Lean Start Up.
- **Activities:**
  - Facilitate discussions to identify key business objectives and how our framework stack can contribute.

## Jobs To Be Done (JTBD)

By starting with JTBD, we gain a deep empathy for the customer's motivations, pain points, and desired outcomes. It helps us develop a clear understanding of what "job" our customer is hiring us to do, which is critical for rapid prototyping.

Below you will find our structured approach for implementing the Jobs To Be Done (JTBD) framework for our clients.

### Step 2: User Research and Persona Development

#### 2.1 Defining Target User Segments

- **Objective:** Identify and prioritize user segments to tailor JTBD analysis.
- **Activities:**
  - Collaborate with product managers to understand their user base.
  - Utilize existing data and conduct additional research to define distinct user segments.

#### 2.2 Persona Creation

- **Objective:** Develop detailed user personas to guide JTBD exploration.
- **Activities:**
  - Conduct collaborative workshops with product managers to capture user behaviors and motivations.
  - Document personas reflecting the diverse needs and goals of identified user segments.

### Step 3: Job Mapping and Prioritization

#### 3.1 Mapping User Jobs

- **Objective:** Collaboratively map out the primary jobs users aim to accomplish with the data product.
- **Activities:**
  - Conduct joint workshops with product managers to identify and document user jobs.
  - Consider both functional and emotional aspects of the identified jobs.

#### 3.2 Prioritizing Jobs

- **Objective:** Evaluate and prioritize identified jobs based on impact and feasibility.
- **Activities:**
  - Establish a scoring system to assess the significance of each job.
  - Collaborate with product managers to align job priorities with development timelines.

### Step 4: Documentation and Knowledge Sharing

#### 4.1 Repository of JTBD Insights

- **Objective:** Create a shared repository documenting JTBD insights and outcomes.
- **Activities:**
  - Document the entire JTBD process, including target user segments, research findings, and job maps.
  - Develop a knowledge-sharing platform.

## The Lean Startup

Popularized by Eric Ries in his book "The Lean Startup," this framework draws inspiration from lean manufacturing principles and agile development practices. Successful startups such as Dropbox and Airbnb attribute part of their success to the Lean Startup approach.

### Step 5: Customer Development and Validation

#### 5.1 Defining Customer Personas

- **Objective:** Clearly define and understand the target audience for the data product.
- **Activities:**
  - Collaborate with product managers to identify and document customer personas.
  - Utilize data and insights gathered from previous user research for effective persona creation.

#### 5.2 Hypothesis Formulation

- **Objective:** Formulate hypotheses about user needs, problems, and potential solutions.
- **Activities:**
  - Facilitate collaborative sessions to generate and document hypotheses with product managers.
  - Ensure alignment between hypotheses and overarching business objectives.

### Step 6: MVP Development and Testing

#### 6.1 MVP Design and Build

- **Objective:** Develop a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) based on formulated hypotheses.
- **Activities:**
  - Collaborate on designing a lean version of the product with essential features.
  - Utilize data engineering expertise to efficiently build and deploy the MVP.

#### 6.2 Test and Iterate

- **Objective:** Gather real-world feedback on the MVP to inform further development.
- **Activities:**
  - Establish a testing plan, incorporating user feedback loops and data analytics.
  - Encourage a rapid iteration cycle to refine the product based on user insights.

### Step 7: Pivot or Persevere

#### 7.1 Data-Driven Decision-Making

- **Objective:** Use data analytics to inform strategic decisions on whether to pivot or persevere.
- **Activities:**
  - Analyze user feedback and performance metrics to evaluate the success of the MVP.
  - Collaborate with product managers to make informed decisions on adjusting the product strategy.

#### 7.2 Pivot Strategy

- **Objective:** Define a strategic pivot plan if the MVP requires significant adjustments.
- **Activities:**
  - Collaborate on identifying alternative hypotheses and pivoting the product direction if necessary.
  - Ensure a smooth transition in development efforts based on validated learning.

### Step 8: Scaling and Growth

#### 8.1 Scaling Strategies

- **Objective:** Develop strategies for scaling the product based on validated success.
- **Activities:**
  - Collaborate with product managers to identify scalable features and functionalities.
  - Integrate scalability considerations into ongoing development efforts.

#### 8.2 Continuous Improvement

- **Objective:** Foster a culture of continuous improvement and optimization.
- **Activities:**
  - Establish regular retrospectives to reflect on the effectiveness of Lean Startup principles.
  - Encourage ongoing learning and adaptation to evolving market conditions.

### Step 9: Documentation and Knowledge Sharing

#### 9.1 Knowledge Repository

- **Objective:** Document insights and outcomes from Lean Startup applications for reference.
- **Activities:**
  - Create a centralized repository for Lean Startup documentation, including hypothesis testing results and strategic decisions.
  - Share insights with the wider team to promote knowledge sharing.

#### 9.2 Training and Integration

- **Objective:** Ensure team members are well-versed in Lean Startup principles and practices.
- **Activities:**
  - Integrate Lean Startup training into onboarding processes for new team members.
  - Provide ongoing support and resources to facilitate continuous learning.

### Step 10: Continuous Monitoring and Evaluation

#### 10.1 Metrics and KPIs

- **Objective:** Define metrics and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for ongoing evaluation.
- **Activities:**
  - Collaborate with product managers to establish KPIs aligned with business objectives.
  - Regularly monitor and analyze metrics to assess the impact of Lean Startup practices on product performance.
