**Products are the manifestation of a mission to deliver value to users.**

As a product leader, it's your responsability to make the above a reality. It's a promise you're making to your users and your business. And the product is how you are fulfilling this mission.

To assess progress, you need to consider 2 core aspects of that promise:
- What is the value you are promising your users? How can you evaluate if they are indeed getting that value from using your product?
- Are you able get users in, onboarded and engaged? Are they behaving in a way that demonstrates that your mission and how you fulfill your product's promise resonates with them?
