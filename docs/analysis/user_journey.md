Growth through segmentation: lifecycle analysis to understand your users

* https://mixpanel.com/blog/2019/12/03/growth-through-segmentation-lifecycle-analysis-to-understand-your-users/
* "Not all users are created equal. Segmenting users into different groups and tracking their movement between different engagement states is a great way to get a deeper understanding of your users and find opportunities for further growth."
* "2 kinds of segmentation analyses you can run:
  * Lifecycle analysis: breaking down your active users into new users, retained users, and resurrected users to understand how your user base is growing. 
  * Engagement segmentation analysis: segmenting users into “core” and “power” users, and understanding how users move from one state of engagement to the other."
* "By breaking up the active user base into [new users, retained users, resurrected users, and dormant users], it helps to reveal what exactly is contributing to the growth (or shrinkage!) of your user base, and helps teams build more sustainable user growth."
* "Lifecycle analysis helps you account for the different journeys your users experience based on their usage and engagement with your product and helps you uncover what moved the needle or caused a drop in terms of user base growth. "
* "Where the lifecycle analysis report helped us understand user base growth, in this section, we’re going to look at how we can calculate the rate at which users move from a low state of engagement to higher states of engagement to help us understand how effectively we’re converting users into high-value users."
* "What we really want to know is: is the power [user] cohort actually growing? And if so, why? When a user becomes a power [user], do they stay a power watcher? Or is there a lot of movement between engagement states that make it more unpredictable?"

* There are hardly breakthroughs into the metrics that should have your full attention whenever growing a product. And we all know that customer retention is key - the math behind leaky buckets rarely leads to solid growth. But it's how you analyze customer retention and how you act on it that is important and can lead to breakthroughs.
* This guide from Segment is their own tactical approach to understanding and acting on customer retention.
* First thing to explore is not churn, but what makes your best customers stick. Segment comes up with an Activation score that measures how engaged a user is.
* Another angle to look at retention is by splitting it between early, middle and late. There are different objectives in a user’s journey during different phases and retention should itself be understood differently during those phases.
* This article also covers other tactics such as measuring an account’s vitality, preventing accidental churn, etc.
