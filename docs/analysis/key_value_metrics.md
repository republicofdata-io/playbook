**Key Value Metrics are the lanterns that should illuminate your path as a product leader.**

You iteratively and incrementally move your product forward by formulating hypothesis on how the product can further deliver on its promise. Those hypothesis should have a measurable outcome, which should really be about how your product further delivers value to its users.

This is the purpose of Key Value Metrics.
