:::info Goal
What is an actual path-discovery engine? How is it a practice and a process that you inject in all product management's workflows?
:::

There a multiple ways to define that engine:
- In Lean Startup, we would talk of the "build, measure and learn" cycle.
- Elsewhere, it could defined as "experiment, inspect and adapt".

Regardless of the step names, the path-discovery is: 
- **iterative** - product teams quicly cycle through an iteration of development, measurement and learning to take steps forward, assess their progress and re-evaluate their path forward. 
- Rooted in **measurable outcomes** - being data-driven is to use data to take an incremental step on a path towards a product goal.
- **incremental** - those cycles are quick because we want to take small steps and assess our position before taking another step forward.
