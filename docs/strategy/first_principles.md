Analytics should have a purpose. It’s not an end in itself, but an artifact that leads to knowledge. We are helping to instrument our products so that analysis relies on high-quality data. We don’t instrument everything, but just what is meaningful.

It’s about asking the right questions, going to the foundational principles that feeds knowledge, then action. In the case of product analytics, we are instrumenting products to answer those foundational questions that drives strategy.

I agree, it all sounds a bit esoteric and fuzzy, but I believe that analytics is at a crossroad between engineering and actual business analysis. The technical challenges are quite stimulating for sure, but at the end of the day, they’re useless if we’re generating data that answers the wrong questions.
