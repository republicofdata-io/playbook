:::info Goal
What does it means for product leaders to use data in uncovering their product's path forward?
:::

**Data-driven is analytics with a purpose.**

Data is not an end in itself, but an artifact that leads to knowledge. We instrument products so that decisions can be informed by relevant user behavioural data.

It’s about asking the right questions first. Wayfinding a product's path forward. Aligning the business mission and the user's workflows with the product design.

Our playbook is built on that foundational principal: **data does not replace decision-making, its just an input in a product leader's discovery journey.**
