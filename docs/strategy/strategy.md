# Using a Comprehensive, Bottom-Up Approach

We build data products from the bottom up with four key areas in mind: Fundamental Principles, Engineering Best Practices, Product Management, and Portfolio Strategy.

Here's a quick visual overview of our approach: 

<<INSERT OLIVIER'S DIAGRAM FOR OUR APPROACH>>

Each of these sections is documented in our Playbook, which is what you're reading right now. Below you'll find an overview of key Frameworks and SOPs that we're currently using. And again, we plan to continue to add to this documentation as we go - it is far from complete!

# With Rapid Product Discovery and Prototyping

At RepublicofData.io, we start every product discovery sprint by using the Jobs To Be Done framework. By starting with JTBD, we gain a deep empathy for the customer's motivations, pain points, and desired outcomes. It helps us develop a clear understanding of what "job" our customer is hiring us to do, which is critical for effective prototyping.

## Section 2: Jobs To Be Done (JTBD)

### History of the Framework:
**Inventors:** The Jobs To Be Done (JTBD) framework was developed by Clayton Christensen, a Harvard Business School professor, and his colleagues in the early 2000s. It emerged from the study of disruptive innovations and the understanding that customers "hire" products or services to get specific jobs done.

**Famous Usage:** JTBD has been widely applied in various industries, from technology to consumer goods. Notably, companies like Airbnb and Intercom have utilized JTBD principles to enhance their product development and user experience strategies.

**Popularity in Product Management:** JTBD has gained popularity in product management due to its focus on understanding the underlying motivations of users. It is used to design products that address specific needs and solve real problems for customers.

### Overview of Use in Practice:
1. **Identifying Jobs:** Conduct thorough research to identify the core "jobs" or tasks that users are trying to accomplish. Understand the functional and emotional aspects of their needs.

2. **Segmentation:** Segment users based on the specific jobs they are trying to fulfill. Recognize that different user segments may have distinct jobs and priorities.

3. **Product Design:** Develop products that align with the identified jobs. Prioritize features and improvements that directly contribute to fulfilling user needs.

4. **Feedback Loop:** Establish a continuous feedback loop to validate assumptions and gather insights. Regularly reassess user jobs and iterate on the product to remain aligned with evolving user needs.

## Section 3: The Lean Startup

### History of the Framework:
**Inventors:** The Lean Startup methodology was popularized by Eric Ries in his book "The Lean Startup," published in 2011. It draws inspiration from lean manufacturing principles and agile development practices.

**Famous Usage:** The Lean Startup has been widely embraced by startups and established companies alike. Successful startups such as Dropbox and Airbnb attribute part of their success to the Lean Startup approach.

**Popularity in Product Management:** The Lean Startup methodology has become a cornerstone of modern product management. Its principles of iterative development, validated learning, and efficient resource utilization are highly applicable in fast-paced product environments.

### Overview of Use in Practice:
1. **Build-Measure-Learn:** Adopt a cycle of continuous improvement through the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop. Build a minimum viable product (MVP), measure its performance, and learn from user feedback to inform the next iteration.

2. **Validated Learning:** Prioritize validated learning over traditional metrics. Focus on learning what works and what doesn't to refine product features and strategies.

3. **Iterative Development:** Embrace rapid and iterative development cycles. Avoid lengthy planning phases and aim to quickly bring products to market, allowing for faster adaptation based on user responses.

4. **Pivot or Persevere:** Be prepared to pivot or persevere based on feedback and data. If the product is not meeting user needs, consider pivoting to a new direction; otherwise, persevere and enhance successful features.

# And an Emphasis on Portfolio Risk Mitigation

### History of the Framework:
**Developers:** The EthicalOS Risk Mitigation Checklist was developed by the Institute for the Future (IFTF) as part of the broader Ethical OS Toolkit. The toolkit was created to help organizations anticipate and navigate the ethical implications of technology.

**Famous Usage:** The Ethical OS Toolkit has gained recognition for its practical approach to addressing ethical challenges in technology. While not as widely known as some other frameworks, it has been utilized by organizations committed to responsible innovation.

**Popularity in Product Management:** The EthicalOS Risk Mitigation Checklist is particularly relevant in product management for its focus on identifying and mitigating ethical risks associated with emerging technologies, aligning with a growing emphasis on responsible and ethical product development.

### Overview of Use in Practice:
1. **Scenario Exploration:** Use the toolkit's scenario exploration to envision potential ethical challenges related to your data product. Consider how these challenges might manifest and impact users.

2. **Ethical Risk Assessment:** Conduct an ethical risk assessment specific to your data product. Identify potential risks related to data privacy, security, bias, and other ethical considerations.

3. **Values Assessment:** Engage in a values assessment to identify and prioritize the values guiding your data product development. Consider ethical principles such as transparency, fairness, and user autonomy.

4. **Iterative Use:** Utilize the toolkit iteratively throughout the development lifecycle. Revisit scenarios, conduct additional risk assessments as the project progresses, and adapt strategies based on new insights.
