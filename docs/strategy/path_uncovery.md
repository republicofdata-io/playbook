The product leader's role is to guide the product's development down a path that serves their customer's job-to-be-done, but also grow the business.

As stated by Satnam Singh in [an episode of This Is Product Management](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/this-is-product-management/id975284403?i=1000559295983): a product leader is being presented with different paths for their product. Its role is to assess them and make the right steps forward.

**Product leaders evaluate those paths, decide on which one to move forward on, take small steps, assess their situation and decide whether to keep moving forward or not.**

As Brandon Chu explains in "[Making good decisions as a product manager](https://blackboxofpm.com/making-good-decisions-as-a-product-manager-c66ddacc9e2b)":

> Typically, the most important decisions that a PM makes are, in order:
> - Why a team exists (vision and the impact they aspire to create)
> - What the general approach is to accomplish the vision (strategy)
> - What to build now, and what not to build (project prioritization)
> - What the smallest thing that can be built is that achieves the impact (MVP)

Small steps are informed by vision, strategy and prioritization. It's about developing a process to wayfind your product's path to growth.

Such a process can only succeed based on multiple factors, one of them being data-driven. Or the art of injecting relevant data in the product decision-making process.
