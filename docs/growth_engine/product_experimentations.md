* "Here’s the experimentation infrastructure Imperfect Foods use:
  * Collect user event data from the Imperfect Food website via Segment.
  * Send user event data to Split.io and AB Tasty for experimentation.
  * Send user event data and test results to Snowflake for data warehousing.
  * Run queries and build reports in Mode Analytics and Amplitude."
* "Here’s the process they landed on:
  * Define your problem and hypothesis clearly. Know the question you want to answer and set up your test around that question.
  * Pick a reliable leading measure to move. Don’t choose lagging measures because it will take too long to see results and gauge impact in the short term.
  * Do things that are not scalable to start. You’ll get to your findings faster and can worry about scaling things like automation and admin tools later, when you know there’s value.
  * Don’t stress over smaller sample sizes. You should aim instead for a large sample size.
  * Choose bold ideas. You won’t see big gains without breaking new ground.
  * Share your learnings broadly. This helps all departments benefit from the findings of each experiment and creates a culture that celebrates and prioritizes experimentation."
