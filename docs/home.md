When it comes to empowering a startup's growth strategy through the use of data, product managers have an abundance of SaaS and consulting options, but very little end-to-end solution. Offerings range from product telemetry, and self-serve analysis, to platform over-engineering. Product managers are left on their own to figure out what should be measured, when, why, generate the right data, how to interpret it, and then make informed decisions.

When it comes to the build-measure-learn virtuous cycle from Lean Startups, the explosion of niche offerings has just made it harder to set up an efficient data-driven process and accelerate that cycle.

Driven more by economic opportunities and competitive differentiation, product analytics services are becoming decoupled between strategy, engineering and analysis. This leaves product managers stitching together all components of a data-driven startup growth strategy.

We somehow lost track of what it means to be data-driven. Product managers are being fed the idea that over-engineering equates to being more sophisticated. But growing a startup through data should only mean generating relevant data at the right moment to make the right next decision in your growth path.

We're on a mission to help out product managers make better startup growth decisions by leveraging data. Our framework strikes a balance between strategy, engineering and analysis so that you can quickly set up an effective build-measure-learn cycle and accelerate it.
