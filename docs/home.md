It used to be that being data-driven meant simply having a data warehouse and a business intelligence tool. Those days are behind us. Data now proliferates within organizations at an astonishing rate, and individuals at every level are empowered to develop data products that can deliver significant value.

## The New Era of Data Products

The rapid growth in data products is exhilarating, but it also invites us to aim higher than mere functionality—to embrace the roles of data guardians and champions of societal good. We're not just allowing everyone to build data tools. We're guiding that creativity toward frameworks that boost not only productivity but also drive meaningful change in society.
