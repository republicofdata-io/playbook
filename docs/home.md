When it comes to empowering a startup's growth strategy through data, product leaders have an abundance of SaaS and consulting options, but very few end-to-end solutions. Offerings range from product telemetry, and self-serve analysis, to data platform engineering.

Driven more by economic opportunities and competitive differentiation, product analytics services are becoming decoupled between strategy, engineering and analysis. This leaves product leaders to stitch together all components of a data-driven startup growth strategy.

We became good at generating data. But not at using it to discern the most viable path forward for our products. We somehow lost track of what it means to be data-driven.

:::tip Our Mission
To be the ally of product leaders in successfully using data to uncover their product’s path to growth.
:::

We of course care about how to generate product data. But not only. As "data-driven" implies, data is only a means to an end. Our playbook is our approach to **assemble and fine-tune your data-driven path discovery engine**.

## What we'll cover

- The data-driven **strategy** first, what it means for product leaders to use data in uncovering their product's path forward.
- What is an actual **path-discovery engine**, how beyond being a data platform, it is a practice and a process that you inject in all product management's workflows.
- How to **engineer** that engine, the options you have, being diligent in only building what you need first, and establishing an architecture that scales.
- And finally, how to **analyse** that data to inform the relevant and time-sensitive decisions for you to take the next step forward towards product growth.
