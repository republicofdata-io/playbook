Product leaders are on a quest to steer the development of their products on a path to growth. Their output is decision-making. So they need the right input to assess how to move forward and if that path leads to desired outcomes.

Inputs are multiple: interviews with users, feedback from support teams, strategic direction from the leadership team, data, intuition, etc. Data is just one input that product leaders process to make informed decisions. For it to be valuable, data needs to be timely, relevant and accurate. 

**Being data-driven is essentially a quest for product leaders to translate data into actionable insights**. But as businesses grow, data production usually becomes an engineering pursuit. Product managers become one of many clients. Data initiatives are evaluated against compliance with SLAs and not by how they contribute to moving the business forward.

## Purpose

:::tip Our Mission
We believe that data-driven product development is a process, not a technological stack. We’re on a mission to be the allies of product leaders who want to enrich their decision-making with relevant, time-sensitive and accurate data.
:::

This playbook is our approach to assembling and fine-tuning a data-driven and iterative product development decision-making engine.

## What we'll cover

- The data-driven **strategy** first, what it means for product leaders to use data in uncovering their product's path forward.
- What is an actual **path-discovery engine**, how beyond being a data platform, it is a practice and a process that you inject in all product management's workflows.
- How to **engineer** that engine, the options you have, being diligent in only building what you need first, and establishing an architecture that scales.
- And finally, how to **analyse** that data to inform the relevant and time-sensitive decisions for you to take the next step forward towards product growth.
