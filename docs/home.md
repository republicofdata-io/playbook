When it comes to empowering a startup's growth strategy through the use of data, product owners have an abundance of SaaS and consulting options, but very little end-to-end solution. Offerings range from product telemetry, self-serve analysis, to platform over-engineering. Product owners are left on their own to figure out what should be measured, when, why, generate the right data, how to interpret it, then make informed decisions.

When it comes to the build-measure-learn virtuous cycle from Lean Startups, the explosion of niche offerings has just made it harder to set up an efficient data-driven process and to accelerate that cycle.

Driven more by economic opportunities and competitive differentiation, product analytics services are becoming decoupled between strategy, engineering and analysis. This is leaving product owners to stitch together all components of a data-driven startup growth strategy.

We somehow lost track of what it means to be data-driven. Product owners are being fed the idea that over-engineering equates to being more sophisticated. But growing a startup through the use of data should only really mean to generate relevant data at the right moment to make the right next decision in your growth path.

We're on a mission to help out product owners make better startup growth decisions by leveraging data. Our framework strikes a balance between strategy, engineering and analysis so that you can set up an effective build-measure-learn cycle quickly and accelerate it.
